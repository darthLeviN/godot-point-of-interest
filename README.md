# Godot point of interest
This is currently an incomplete demo. If i have the time to finish it, i will turn it into a full fledged addon.
The idea is to have IK tools which would give polished result.
Implementation will be done in GDScript for ease of development. But for production it's recommended to be reimplemented in C++

# Features
As shown below, you should be able to limit the freedom of each bone in the IK chain.
